# BookShelfProblem
An excercise I worked on to get a little more comfortble with c++


## usage:

### $./prac filename

./prac invokes executable binary
filename such as ex1 shown below
where the first line is the available 
shelves and the following lines contain
the books starting with their size and 
followed with their title.

```
  150 150 300 150 150
  70 A Game of Thrones
  76 A Clash of Kings
  99 A Storm of Swords
  75 A Feasts for Crows
  105 A Dance With Dragons
```
